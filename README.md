# fodder (WIP)
`fodder` is a small Go program that attempts to recognize usernames from different videogame streams. The OCR is not yet calibrated for the images it recieves so expect some wonkiness.

Please note: This was written with the intention of learning golang as I went along, so don't expect anything too fancy (*yet?*)
